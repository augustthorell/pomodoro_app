# Pomodoro app

Built with Flutter

## Progress

I wanted to work with flutter and create a pomodoro app where the user can set the time for the sessions.

I also wanted to have a todo list which show the current Todo for the user.

What's left:
* Making the Reorderable list work and update the state.
